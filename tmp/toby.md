> [!info] A Note from Harsha:
Thanks to everyone who's reached out about Toby. I wanted to put all the facts about what's going on in one place. **Your support means a lot right now.**

## The Lead-Up

This all started around our trip to D.C. He was already showing some signs of being sick before or during the trip, mostly not eating and being really lethargic. When we got back home early on Wednesday, September 3rd, he got much, much worse.

## Friday, September 5th

Friday was a nightmare. Toby's condition got so bad I had to rush him to the emergency vet.

  

- The first blood tests showed he was in a full-blown crisis. His kidneys were failing. His liver was in serious trouble, which was causing his jaundice. He was fighting a major infection, and he was dangerously dehydrated.
    
- The vets diagnosed him with severe pancreatitis. They think the inflammation from his pancreas triggered a chain reaction that started shutting down his other organs.
    
- He was too sick for the regular vet, so they transferred him to Sage, a 24/7 critical care hospital.
    
- Things got even worse at Sage. They found a life-threatening complication from his blood work. His platelet count was so low that his blood wasn't clotting properly.
    
- Given how many things were going wrong, the vets told me he had a 50/50 chance of making it.

## Saturday, September 6th

Today, things started to turn around. It's the first time I've felt any real hope.

- The biggest news is that they fixed the blood clotting problem. That was the most immediate danger, and it's now completely resolved. It's a huge relief.
    
- He hasn't vomited at all today.
    
- They put in a feeding tube to get nutrition into him, and he's handling it well.
    
- He also ate a small amount of food on his own. The vets said this is a fantastic sign. It means his nausea is getting under control and he's starting to feel a little bit like himself again.
    
- New blood work shows his organ values are finally starting to move in the right direction.
    

## Sunday, September 7th

The update this morning shows Toby is holding steady. It wasn't a day of big breakthroughs like yesterday, but the important thing is that he's stable and not getting worse.

- He's still not interested in eating on his own, so he's getting all his nutrition through his feeding tube. The main goal right now is to get him to eat.
    
- They tried to wean him off the dextrose (sugar) in his IV fluids overnight, but his blood sugar didn't stay stable on its own. It's a small setback. They've put him back on the sugar for now, and his levels are back to normal with that support.
    
- There's more good news from his blood work. His bilirubin, a key liver value, has improved a little more. They're waiting on more lab results later today.
    
- The vet says he's quiet but alert and seems comfortable. He's holding his own.

**Current Status (Sunday Morning):** Toby is in what the vet calls a "holding pattern." There haven't been any major steps forward or backward, which is good news in a situation this serious. He's stable, but he still relies on the feeding tube for food and the IV for his blood sugar. We're waiting for more blood work this afternoon. The focus remains on getting him strong enough to eat and for his body to manage its own sugar levels.
