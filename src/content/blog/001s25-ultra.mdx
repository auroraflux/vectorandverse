So, I did the thing. I succumbed to the siren song of consumerism and snagged myself an S25 Ultra on Friday. After a weekend of meticulously analyzing every pixel and nanosecond of processing speed, I've come to a conclusion so groundbreaking, so earth-shattering, it might just break the internet (or at least strain your data plan): We're officially out of mind-blowing phone upgrades. *Gasp!* The horror! It's like we've reached the peak of Maslow's Hierarchy of Phone Needs, and now we're just milling around at the top, desperately searching for something, *anything*, to complain about.

Remember those heady days of yore when a new phone felt like you were holding a piece of the future, a magical portal to a world of endless possibilities? Yeah, those days are deader than a doornail, flatter than a pancake, more extinct than the dodo. If your current phone still has a headphone jack, maybe, just maybe, you'll notice a significant difference with a new one. (Yes, I'm sorry if that one hurts, but I went there...deal with it). Otherwise, prepare to be underwhelmed. It'll be shinier and a touch faster, but life-altering? Nah.

## It's Still a Phenomenal Phone (Kind Of)

But let's not get ahead of ourselves here. While it's not a revolution, the S25 Ultra *is* a seriously capable piece of kit.  It truly is a testament to human ingenuity, a sleek and powerful device that can be your primary computer, your creative studio, and your window to the world. It can handle almost any task you throw at it.

Here's the catch, though, and it's a catch so big it could swallow Moby Dick whole: it's only *phenomenal* if you haven't upgraded in, like, two years. We've become so hopelessly addicted to the "new shiny," so enslaved by the relentless upgrade cycle, that we can't seem to admit that, maybe, just maybe, we don't need the "absolute best" every single year. Our wallets certainly don't need it. Neither does our sanity. And let's not even get started on the e-waste mountain we're all contributing to with this endless upgrade cycle.  Somewhere, a landfill is weeping silicon tears because I just *had* to have slightly better low-light photography.  We're basically trading fleeting moments of tech-induced dopamine for the slow-motion destruction of the planet.  Fun times!

It's the same tired song and dance with the iPhone. The 16 isn't going to spontaneously make you levitate with joy compared to the 15. It's not going to solve world hunger or bring about world peace. It's just a phone. And just like Samsung, Apple is leaning hard into "Apple Intelligence" because, well, that's where the innovation is right now. Until we get...I don't know, holographic projectors that can beam us to that tropical beach on demand or brain implants that allow us to download knowledge directly into our cerebral cortex, this is what we've got. Incremental upgrades. Evolutionary, not revolutionary. *And maybe, just maybe, that's okay.*

## Tech Media's Hype Machine (and Our Exhaustion With It)

And this incrementalism?  It's driving the tech media absolutely bonkers. Naturally, the tech media, those tireless champions of consumer advocacy (and clickbait), are having an absolute field day with this. Why? Because reviewing the S25 Ultra on its own merits is about as thrilling as watching grass grow in slow motion. "It's got a great screen!" they'll say. "The camera is amazing!" they'll proclaim. Yeah, *no shit*, Sherlock. Flagship phone in [current year]. Potato with a lens? Please. Honestly, the *marketing* around these things is half the problem.  It's like they're trying to sell us oxygen, but with slightly shinier packaging and a 5% "performance boost" in breathability.  'Experience the *all-new* way to breathe!' Give me a break. It's exhausting just keeping up with the breathless pronouncements of how this year's rectangle is *totally* different, *absolutely* essential, and will *fundamentally* change your life. Spoiler alert: it won't.

Instead, we get endless, agonizing comparisons to the previous generation, each article meticulously dissecting the most minute differences, fueling the fires of the "Tech is Dead!" crowd. You know the type...the ones who think phone companies are personally victimizing them by not releasing a phone that can teleport you to Mars every year. It's almost as if they've forgotten that the devices we carry around in our pockets are more powerful than the computers that sent people to the moon. But hey, negativity sells, and who needs a healthy dose of perspective when you can have manufactured outrage and a side of existential dread?

## The Spectator Sport of Online Phone Debates

And who are these debates *really* for? Honestly, these phone debates have become a spectator sport for the hyper-analytical. We're not talking about casual users here; these are people who can dissect a spec sheet with the precision of a brain surgeon. They're incredibly intelligent, devouring every review, every leak, every YouTube analysis. The irony? Most of them have zero intention of ever buying the phone. They just want to engage in these elaborate online debates, armed with their encyclopedic knowledge, all under the guise of being an "informed consumer" of a product they'll never consume.

Maybe it's just another form of tribalism in our hyper-connected world.  It's not Samsung *versus* Apple anymore, it's "S24 Ultra die-hards" battling "S25 Ultra converts," or iPhone 15 loyalists squaring off against the iPhone 16 hopefuls. It gives people a team to root for, a side to defend, within the *same brand ecosystem*, in a world that often feels confusing and chaotic. And hey, at least it's cheaper than therapy, right?

## Cynicism: Our Default Setting

This whole spectacle feeds into a larger problem: we're drowning in cynicism. It's not just that pessimism sells; it's like it's the only language we understand anymore. Any hint of optimism, any praise at all, is instantly met with suspicion. It's like we've become allergic to good news. If it's not negative, or at least laced with a healthy dose of negativity, we dismiss it as fake. Look, I'm not saying we should all pretend the world is sunshine and rainbows, but can we at least acknowledge that there's a space between "perfect utopia" and "everything is a dumpster fire"?

## The Case of the Neutered Stylus (and Manufactured Outrage) 

Take the whole stylus Bluetooth kerfuffle, for example. Apparently, removing Bluetooth functionality from the S25 Ultra's stylus is the tech equivalent of punting a basket full of kittens into the sun. Samsung, those heartless corporate overlords, dared to look at their *actual telemetry usage data* (gasp!), saw that less than 1% of Ultra users were actually using those Bluetooth features, and decided, "You know what? Let's ditch it and make the battery life even better."  And guess what? The S25 Ultra battery life is suspiciously, almost miraculously, better. Obviously, it's not the *only* factor in better battery life, and it might not even be a huge one, but seriously...coincidence? I think not! But hey, let's ignore that glaringly obvious connection and continue to clutch our pearls about the poor, neutered stylus. We must find something to be angry about, even if we have to invent it ourselves!

## Dragon's Dogma 2 and the Internet's Fury (Even When You're Having Fun)

![dd2](/images/blog/001s25-ultra/dd2.png)

Speaking of pointless arguments fueled by internet outrage, this all reminds me of a video game I purchased last year: _Dragon's Dogma 2_. Thinking it looked cool, I chose not to read any reviews, forum posts, or subreddits centered around it, figuring it might be a nice little escape from the soul-crushing monotony of everyday life. I decided to take a risk and see if it was worth playing. Turns out, it was! I happily sunk 35 hours into it, practically counting down the minutes at work until I could once again slay dragons and explore fantastical landscapes. Then I made the fatal mistake of venturing onto Reddit for some tips...apparently, I was supposed to be _furious_ about a bunch of things, half of which I didn't even know existed: microtransactions, performance issues, a lack of fast travel! The internet had spoken, and I was clearly playing the game wrong.

But before I go on, let me address the *obvious*: Debating the merits of a $1300 phone versus a $59 game is peak 'first world problems' territory.  There are actual, you know, *real* problems in the world.  But hey, we're on the internet talking about phones and games, so might as well lean into it, right?  And maybe, just maybe, by dissecting our anxieties about rectangles of glass and digital dragons, we can learn something about our broader anxieties in general.  Or maybe not.  Either way, existential dread, now with 5G!

## The Existential Question: Ignorance vs. "Informed" Misery

So, here's a question for the internet hive mind, a question that keeps me up at night, tossing and turning in a cold sweat: If I'm blissfully ignorant of the supposed flaws in something and still enjoy it, am I wrong? Does the existence of those flaws, even if I'm completely unaware of them, somehow invalidate my enjoyment? I bet a lot of gamers, and a lot of phone enthusiasts, would have a full-blown existential crisis trying to answer that.

## Redefining "Flagship" (Maybe)

Maybe we need to redefine what a 'flagship' phone even *is*.  Instead of chasing the bleeding edge every year, maybe a *true* flagship is the phone that still feels great after two or three years.  The one that meets *your* needs, not some arbitrary benchmark on a spec sheet.  The one that you actually *enjoy* using, regardless of what the internet thinks.  Now *that* would be a genuinely revolutionary concept.

## Time to Touch Grass (and Live a Little)

![touch-grass](/images/blog/001s25-ultra/grass.png)

Look, I'm 33. That's old enough to know better, but still young enough to occasionally make questionable life choices, like engaging with anything on the internet, ever. But statistically, I'm about halfway to the end, assuming I survive the impending climate wars, of course. So, the big question is: how do I want to spend my remaining time on this mortal coil? Do I want to get sucked into the black hole of online 'team sports' debates about phones, where the arguments are circular, the stakes are nonexistent, and the products in question will be obsolete before the next election cycle? Do I want to spend my precious few remaining years watching people yell at each other about which billionaire's rectangle is superior? Hard pass. I think I'll go outside. Maybe touch some grass. You know, live a little.

## Finding Happiness in *My* Phone (and Ignoring the Echo Chamber)

Ultimately, I like my phone. It's pretty, it's fast, the battery lasts significantly longer than my attention span, and it makes me happy. Is it the *only* phone that could do that? Absolutely not. There are plenty of other rectangles of glass and metal out there that could provide a similar level of satisfaction. Probably ones that could have done it for a lot cheaper. But it's the one *I* chose. And lately, that feels a whole lot more powerful, a whole lot more meaningful, than letting the internet echo chamber dictate what I should think, what I should buy, and what I should be outraged about.
