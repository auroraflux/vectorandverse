It's March 20th, 2025. Toby's wearing one of those plastic vet cones in my passenger seat. It makes him look like the world's saddest satellite dish. His paw's wrapped in tan bandage, a marble-sized tumor in there, recently drained. The vet gave it a 75% chance of being malignant cancer.

He's staring at me with that look. Fix this, Dad.

*I can't.*

Sitting there, with the heater running in the early morning, I tried to remember how we got here. Not just to this vet parking lot, but to this whole arrangement where this small creature depends on me for literally everything.

## The Fine Print Was All in Paw Prints

About 5 years ago, I rescued a two-year-old Yorkshire Terrier mix. Though sitting here now, I'm pretty sure he's the one who did the rescuing. Yeah, I *know*. But sometimes the cliche is just true.

Here's what they don't tell you at the adoption center while you're signing papers and pretending you've thought this through: You're not getting a dog. You're becoming someone's entire universe. Their answer to everything. The solution to problems they can't even articulate.

Can't jump off the couch? *Dad lifts me.*  

Scary noise outside? *Dad checks.* 

Hungry at 5:47 AM? *Dad.*  

Cold? *Dad.*

My paw hurts and I don't understand why? *Dad fixes it.*  

That leaf moved suspiciously? *Dad, we're under attack.*

*Dad*. **Dad**. ***Dad***.

Except sometimes Dad's just a guy in the driver's seat, looking at a dog in a cone, googling 'dog paw tumor survival rate' while pretending he knows what the hell he's doing.

## The Veterinary Lottery Nobody Wants to Win

I found the tumor on a Tuesday because Toby kept obsessively licking his paw like it owed him money. That wasn't like him. When I looked closer, there was this marble-sized lump that definitely wasn't there yesterday.

I sent a photo to the vet. They called back within minutes.

"Bring him in immediately."

Nobody says that about good news.

After they drained it, wrapped it, coned him, the vet gave me the odds. Seventy-five percent chance it's malignant. We'll run tests. Keep him comfortable. Watch for changes.

Then they handed me back my dog, who looked at me like I'd personally invented cones just to ruin his life. The cone sucked. His leg felt weird. Everything was uncomfortable. And somehow, this was all my fault.

Fix it, Dad.

That moment taught me something my parents probably figured out when I was just a few years old and decided to break my arm jumping out of my crib, *hours* before a long plane trip to India: Being someone's *everything* doesn't suddenly make you capable of *shit*.

## The Conspiracy of Capable Adults

When you're young, adults all somehow seem to work together to maintain this beautiful conspiracy. They pretend the mortgage is handled, the car won't break down, and that weird noise in the attic is absolutely nothing to worry about. (Spoiler: It's usually rats. It's always rats.)

They build you this world of fake competence. Not because it's true, but because they know that *you* need to believe it's true. Because the alternative (knowing your parents are just winging it, terrified, stressed, and trying their best) would break your tiny brain.

I never noticed when I crossed from being inside that bubble to being responsible for maintaining it. But sitting in that car with Toby, I *knew*. This was it. This was me, becoming the adult who has to pretend the cone is temporary, the tumor is manageable, *everything's going to be fine*.

Except Toby will never have that moment where he realizes I was just as scared as he was. To him, I'll always be the one who's supposed to know what's happening.


## What We Did to Wolves

Sometimes I lie awake thinking about what we did to wolves.

Not me personally. But us, humans, collectively. We took wolves, actual apex predators, and spent thousands of years turning them into creatures that need us to survive. We engineered dependence. A Yorkshire Terrier exists because somewhere, somehow, somebody looked at a wolf and thought, "You know what this needs? More anxiety and less ability to survive." 

Toby can't open doors. Can't find food without me. Has a panic attack when I go to the bathroom without him. The other day, he got confused by his own reflection and needed emotional support. We created beings that experience existential crisis when we leave for work and think the mailman is plotting their assassination.

That's not good or bad. It's just true. And it means we owe them something.

Not guilt. Not pity. Just presence.

And maybe some of those overpriced treats from the boutique pet store that we all pretend we're not buying. (Yes you, you know who you are, stop lying to yourselves)

## The Art of Staying Put

Toby doesn't need me to cure pancreatitis. He needs me to be the familiar smell in a vet's office that reeks of fear and disinfectant. He doesn't need me to eliminate tumors. He needs me to make the cone slightly less like a personal torture device designed by someone who hates joy.

The job isn't to fix everything. The job is to stay.

To be the constant when everything else is shifting. To maintain the performance of capability even when you're googling "dog kidney failure prognosis" at 3 AM and your search history looks like you're planning to become an unlicensed veterinarian. To project calm when you're anything but.

It's exhausting. It's thankless. Toby's never going to understand what I'm doing for him. He's never going to appreciate that my Google search history now looks like I'm either becoming a veterinarian or planning something deeply concerning involving canine organs. But it's what we signed up for, whether we knew it or not.

## The Weight of Being God to an 18-Pound Atheist

I don't have kids, so I won't pretend to understand that particular flavor of terror. But I know what it's like to be someone's entire world, even if that someone licks themselves clean, thinks "sit" is a suggestion, and genuinely believes he could take a German Shepherd in a fight (seriously, dude, chill out with that).

Every problem Toby's ever had, I've been the solution. Every fear, I've been the comfort. Every need, I've been the provider. When a plastic bag rustles menacingly in the wind, I'm the one who confirms it is *not*, in fact, plotting his demise.

![toby-trust](/images/blog/013-toby/toby-trust.png)

That's a hell of a thing to carry. Not because it's bad, but because it's real. Because one day you wake up and realize you've become the load-bearing retaining wall in another being's existence. And unlike actual walls, you can't just hire a contractor when you start to crack.

## The Hereditary Nature of Winging It

Last week, while holding Toby as he shook from pancreatitis pain, I kept thinking about my mom. How many nights did she sit up with me in bed when I was sick, pretending she wasn't terrified? How many times did my dad stand watching in the doorway, projecting confidence he didn't feel about our family's financial future? How often did they stand *outside* my bedroom door, whispering "What the fuck do we do now?" to each other?

The cone moment in the car wasn't about Toby's mortality. It was about discovering that love creates responsibility for suffering you can't prevent. You can keep them warm, fed, safe from immediate dangers. You can protect them from suspicious leaves and threatening plastic bags. But you can't stop cells from mutating or organs from aging or time from being an absolute *bastard*.

You just get to *be there* while it happens.

## The Invisible Coronation

Nobody tells you when you stop being the protected and start being the protector. There's no ceremony. No certificate. No helpful email from the universe saying "Congratulations, you're the adult now. Good luck with that." 

Just a moment when someone looks at you for answers and you realize you're the adult in the room, even if you still eat cereal for dinner sometimes and your vegetable drawer is where good intentions go to die.

For me, it was a Tuesday in a parking lot, looking at a dog in a cone who trusted me to make sense of something senseless.

The cone came off after a week. The tumor was benign. Toby forgot the whole thing in about three minutes. 

But I still think about that Tuesday. About the weight of that look. *Fix this, Dad.*

I couldn't. But I stayed. 

Sometimes that's all you've got.

And sometimes, *that's all they need*.
