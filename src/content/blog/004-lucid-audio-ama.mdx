As a note, this was taken from the Lucid Audio Experience AMA Forum thread linked here: 

[https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/)

This list was lovingly scraped, fed through Gemini's  creative brain, and hand-corrected by yours truly. Accuracy level: somewhere between "mostly reliable" and "I really tried, okay?" ^read my AI policy^ [^here^](https://vectorandverse.me/about)  Basically, this is the Cliff Notes. Perfect for casual reference but maybe don't stake your reputation on it. If you need sworn testimony, the original thread awaits your verification. Oh, and unless it was said directly by [marqie](https://lucidowners.com/members/marqie.2995/) on the forums, none of this is the official communication of Lucid.

# Detailed list

Here's all the juicy details, with links to the posts. In the format of (##/##), the first number is the post that asked the question, and the second is the post that answers it. I've spot checked and this should be accurate. 

## Confirmed by Lucid (Positive)

### CarPlay & Bluetooth Connectivity and Quality

*   **Wired CarPlay Superiority:** Wired CarPlay provides *significantly* better sound quality than Bluetooth due to the lack of compression.  Bluetooth quality is acknowledged as good, but the wired connection is always optimal. ([#6](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255730) / [#48](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255784), [#48](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255784))
*   **CarPlay Connection Modes:** Lucid CarPlay utilizes both Bluetooth (for initial connection) and WiFi (for data transfer). ([#9](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255733) / [#67](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255806))

### Sound System Tuning and Adjustments

*   **EQ Starting Point:**  The recommended starting point for EQ adjustments is 0-0-0 (flat), reflecting the team's baseline tuning. ([#24](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255750) / [#140](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255891))
*   **Volume Control Linearity:** The volume control curve is custom-designed, approximating a logarithmic scale, and is psychoacoustically tuned for a pleasing experience. ([#22](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255746) / [#137](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255886))
*   **Volume Wheel Sensitivity:**  The volume wheel's sensitivity was intentionally adjusted in a recent update, reducing the range from 100 clicks to 50 for easier and quicker volume changes. ([#32](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255758) / [#146](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255903))
*   **Bass Adjustment Limits:** The bass adjustment range was intentionally limited to -10dB to +6dB.  The -10dB option was added based on customer feedback, while +6dB approaches the woofer's physical limitations. ([#35](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255764) / [#155](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256079))
*   **System Tuning for Motion:** The audio system is tuned for optimal frequency balance *while driving*.  Bass may seem excessive when parked, but Dynamic Speed Control (DSC) (see "In Progress") will address this. ([#83](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255825) / [#83](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255825))
*  **Accurate vs Pleasing:** The team aims for an audio experience that balances accuracy with listening pleasure.([#134](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255883)/[#165](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256108))
*	**Software update:** Software update 2.5 addressed volume level concerns. ([#7](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255731) / [#60](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255799))
*   **Software Upgrade Issue Resolved:** A user issue with a missing audio upgrade (despite having the correct software version) was remotely resolved. ([#65](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255804) / [#90](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255833))
* **SSP Trial:** If the Surreal Sound Pro trial made no noticeable difference, it likely was not enabled. ([#74](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255814) / [#160](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256093))

### Surreal Sound Pro (SSP) & Dolby Atmos

*   **Surreal Sound Pro Tuning:**  Surreal Sound Pro has a "premium" sound signature compared to the standard Surreal Sound, but both share a "family sound." ([#10](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255734) / [#77](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255818))
*   **Gravity Subwoofers:** The Gravity model with Surreal Sound Pro features *two* subwoofers located in the rear. ([#25](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255751) / [#91](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255834))
*   **Speaker Locations (SSP):**  Details of the speaker locations for Surreal Sound Pro were provided. ([#45](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255780) / [#150](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255954))
*   **Balance Disabled in Atmos:** The balance menu is intentionally disabled when playing Dolby Atmos content.  This is a design choice to preserve the intended spatial audio mix.  Alternative methods for balance/fade control are being explored. ([#78](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255819) / [#93](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255836))
*   **Dolby Atmos Staging (Upmixed):** Dolby Atmos content in the Lucid is upmixed to create a more evenly distributed sound field throughout the cabin, unlike the focused "sweet spot" of a home theater setup.  Traditional fade/balance controls would compromise the Atmos mix. ([#80](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255821)/[#96](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255839))
*   **Gravity Audio Tuning (Preliminary):**  The audio tuning for the Gravity model is *not yet finalized*.  The tuning in showroom vehicles represents a preliminary stage. ([#130](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255879) / [#149](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255931))
*  **Balance Setting Issue**: Being looked into ([#21](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255745) / [#126](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255875))

### Hardware & Troubleshooting

*   **Hardware Modification (Bass "Chuffing"):** A hardware modification using butyl tape was implemented to eliminate "chuffing" noises from the woofers, allowing for a retune with improved bass response. ([#8](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255732) / [#73](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255813))
*   **High-Pitched Noise (LEDs):** A high-pitched noise (around 7850 Hz) emanating from the window switch LEDs was confirmed by a user recording.  The team will investigate. ([#85](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255827) / [#73](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255813))
*   **High Pitch Audio Issue (General):** Users experiencing any other high-pitched audio issues are advised to bring their vehicle in for service, as this is not an intentional characteristic. ([#47](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255783) / [#148](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255922))
* **Calibration Track List**: Calibration tracks are available. ([#71](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255810) / [#170](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256126))

### USB Playback

*   **USB Audio Format Support:**  Supported USB audio formats include Dolby Atmos (in MP4 containers) and stereo in WAV, MP3, and FLAC.  USB drive limitations are 32GB capacity and FAT32 formatting. ([#138](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255889) / [#166](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256111), [#166](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256111))

## Confirmed by Lucid (Negative)

*   **No Active Noise Cancellation:** Active noise cancellation is *not* currently planned.  The rationale is the already quiet cabin and the potential for undesirable audio artifacts.  It may be considered in the future. ([#2](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255725) / [#55](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255794))
*   **SS vs. SSP - Hardware Difference:** Surreal Sound and Surreal Sound Pro have *significantly* different hardware.  Upgrading from SS to SSP is not a simple software switch. ([#23](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255747) / [#79](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255820))
*   **No Atmos in Base System:** Dolby Atmos is *not* considered for the base Surreal Sound system due to an insufficient number of channels to properly reproduce the intended spatial audio experience.  The base system aims for competitiveness within its class, while SSP aims to exceed the competition. ([#132](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255881) / [#145](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255900))
*   **Tidal App Issues (Infotainment):** Issues with the Tidal app (favorites, genre information) are *not* within the Audio team's responsibility; they fall under the Infotainment team. ([#17](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255741) / [#159](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256092))
*  **No Winamp:** Winamp is not planned. ([#95](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-255838) / [#162](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256095))
*   **No Audio 'Off' Switch:** An audio 'off' switch is not feasible due to government regulations requiring audible chimes.  Amazon Music is an infotainment issue. ([#164](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256098) / [#164](https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-audio-experience-ama-march-11-2025.11592/post-256098))
