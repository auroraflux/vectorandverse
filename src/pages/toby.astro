              Toby passed away peacefully September 11th, 2025, at 1:36pm. His family was with him.
            </p>

            <p>
              As I write this thinking about the end of Toby's life, I want to spend some time thinking about his life, how far he came, and what he managed to overcome.
            </p>

            <p>
              Toby was a 20 pound Yorkshire Terrier/Dachsund/Schnuazer mix. Yes, that is a mouthful. And yes, his official breed was "Dorkie".
            </p>

            <p>
              Before me, his previous "owners" included an extremely violent and abusive man (resulting in his strong preference for women), and a reasonable set of people that house-trained him and crate-trained him, but left him tethered all the time (resulting in him not knowing how to go on walks on a leash).
            </p>

            <p>
              When I met him, his tail had been cramped due to how permanently he kept it tucked, we had to use relaxants to allow him to poop properly.
            </p>

            <p>
              It took a few months to earn his trust, until finally I was able to hold him. Interestingly enough, that's when I found out that Toby was always the calmest when cradled on his back like a baby, something highly odd for a dog.
            </p>

            <p>
              He became my everyday companion and he lived a life of wonderful luxury with me. Never again would he be fearful in his home. He loved my apartment, and often came to sit with me wherever I went (an impressive amount of persistence, given that my place is only ~500 sqft).
            </p>

            <p>
              He also became my coworker at Google. He had his own badge to wear, he had people who loved him, and he got to feel safe at work too. I was incredibly lucky to have a job that accommodated him.
            </p>

            <p>
              A funny story that I'll never forget about him is this; he was the reason why my laundry was always wrinkled, but not because <em>he</em> wrinkled it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Toby loved my laundry right after it came out of the dryer. Being the bachelor I am, the warm laundry would get plopped on to my bed, waiting for me to decide whether the usual lie I tell myself (I'll definitely fold those and put them on hangars). He loved burrowing in there, "digging" in the pile, making a little nest. It was always adorable to watch.
            </p>

            <p>
              One day, I woke up a little bit late for work and had to jump on a call remotely. My desk is set up in such a way that my bed is behind me (and by extension, seen on my camera when video conferencing...I think you know where this is going).
            </p>

            <p>
              I was giving a strategic talk on a process I wanted to improve. I like humor, and I like adding it in wherever possible, and I did so. I was pleased to see people amused. But when I finished, they were all silently (muted) laughing or smiling still. I'm funny, but I'm not that funny. I got nervous. Then I asked, with a nervous laugh myself, "Wow, my jokes really hit hard today, huh?"
            </p>

            <p>
              Nobody said anything for a moment. Then one person unmuted and said "Um...there's a pair of jeans in the background that has been running around bumping into things and has now hopped up on your bed."
            </p>

            <p>
              Terrified, I turned around, and sure enough, completely stuck in one of my jean pantlegs, were a pair of jeans, partially standing up, seemingly patiently waiting on the bed. If I wasn't panicking so hard, I might have taken a picture, but I immediately went and free'd him.
            </p>

            <p>
              Turns out, the little idiot was doing his usual digging in the laundry pile and somehow got stuck inside one of the jeans legs. He tried to get it out and panicked, and in the process fell off my bed, and was running around, completely blind, <em>bouncing</em> off of various things like my couch and my coffee table, <em>completely unbeknownst to me</em>. I was wearing noise cancelling headphones and was <em>not</em> looking at my own video, so I couldn't see it, but this was on display for everyone else on the call.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since then, my laundry stays in the dryer more often than not, because I couldn't trust Toby, so they would get wrinkled all the time. Not that it seemed to matter, because after that, whenever I put on my jeans, he would make some distance between me and him.
            </p>

            <p>
              That is how I remember him. That is who he is. The goofy, quiet, peaceful, loving little guy who suffered a great deal in early life and deserved all the best for the rest of it. He was also a lesson in bouncing back from the worst of circumstances. He had no reason to ever trust a human again, and had every reason to always be suspicious of us, yet he pulled through.
            </p>

            <p>
              I will miss him. I will be sad.
            </p>

            <p>
              But I know I have done my duty as a father and a caretaker, and that part of the responsibility of having an animal is making the right decisions for the animal even when the right decision hurts.
            </p>

              Here's to Toby, always loved, never forgotten.
