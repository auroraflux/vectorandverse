        <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-12 font-weight-500">
          Why "vector and verse"? What does that even mean?
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">the vector part</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          Vectors are lists of numbers that represent things. In AI, everything becomes vectors: your feelings, your face, your terrible poetry, all reduced to coordinates in mathematical purgatory. I work with systems that are brilliant and surprisingly dumb. Think calculators that write poetry but get confused by doorknobs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">the verse part</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          Verse is the human side: stories, emotions, messy reality. Everything that gets lost when you turn human experience into spreadsheet cells. Why we care about illogical things, make feeling-based decisions, overthink everything at 3 AM. I translate what the math says into what it actually means for people who have feelings and student loans.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">no ads or trackers</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          Zero tracking. Not because I'm on some noble privacy crusade, but because I genuinely don't care about your browsing habits. My complete lack of interest in your data is your best privacy protection. The modern web is a surveillance hellscape, and I refuse to add another tracking pixel to that dumpster fire for the price of half a stale donut.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">my tech stack</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          Basic HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. Built with Astro and lazily hosted on Netlify's free tier because I'm cheap. I make exactly zero dollars here, which perfectly aligns my incentive to exploit your data at absolute zero.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">the ai question</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          Yes, I use AI like everyone else who's discovered that autocomplete now has strong opinions about everything. It's my digital writing assistant that catches typos, generates ideas, and occasionally produces something that doesn't sound like it was written by a motivational speaker having an existential crisis.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-500 mt-4">
          <strong class="font-weight-850">About 80% of AI output gets deleted</strong> for sounding like a LinkedIn influencer who got locked in a fortune cookie factory. The remaining 20% helps me explore ideas and catch embarrassing typos. The final result, with all its flaws and questionable life choices, is entirely my fault.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">why tell you this?</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          I'm not some pretentious artisanal blogger typing manifestos on a hand-cranked typewriter powered by sustainably harvested pinecones, perched in a treehouse made of reclaimed driftwood, wearing denim distressed by authentic woodland creatures, and sipping tea from herbs I foraged blindfolded during a new moon.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-500 mt-4">
          I'm just a caffeinated human with internet access, trying to make sense of both the technical and emotional sides of our weird AI moment. Sure, my digital assistants help with editing and occasionally suggest better ways to explain things, but the final mix of curiosity, skepticism, and questionable humor is all mine. If something here bothers you, that's probably my fault too.
