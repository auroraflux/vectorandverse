        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">the vector part</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          AI is fundamentally about vectors - mathematical representations of meaning, embeddings in high-dimensional space, gradient descent through possibility landscapes. It's elegant, precise, and utterly alien to how we actually live our messy human lives. I spend my days in this world of linear algebra and backpropagation, trying to make sense of systems that are simultaneously brilliant and breathtakingly stupid.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">the verse part</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          Then there's the human story - the verse, the narrative, the beautiful chaos of consciousness that can't be reduced to matrices and attention mechanisms. We're emotional, irrational, creative disasters stumbling through life with hopes and fears that no transformer architecture has ever truly understood. This is where I try to translate between the mathematical and the meaningful.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">zero surveillance</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          This site has zero tracking, not because I'm on a noble privacy crusade, but simply because I genuinely don't care about your browsing habits. My apathy is your best privacy shield. The modern web is a surveillance nightmare fueled by scams and contempt, and I'm not tossing another pixel into that dumpster fire for the price of half a lukewarm coffee.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 font-weight-850">the ai transparency thing</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          Yes, I use AI like everyone else who's discovered that autocomplete has opinions now. It's my digital unpaid intern that catches typos, generates ideas, and occasionally produces something coherent. <strong class="font-weight-850">About 80% of AI output gets deleted</strong> for sounding like a LinkedIn influencer had a baby with a fortune cookie. But the rest? The rest helps me explore the intersection of technical concepts and human experience.<br /><br />
        </p>
        
        <p class="font-weight-500">
          The final chaotic blend of mathematical curiosity, existential dread, and questionable humor? That's entirely my fault. I'm just trying to make sense of a world where we've created minds we don't understand to help us solve problems we can't define.
