        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4" style="font-weight: 850;">no ads or trackers</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 500;">
          This site has zero tracking, not because I'm on a noble privacy crusade, but simply because I genuinely don't care about your browsing habits. My apathy is your best privacy shield. The modern web is a surveillance nightmare fueled by scams and contempt, and I'm not tossing another pixel into that dumpster fire for the price of half a lukewarm coffee.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4" style="font-weight: 850;">my tech stack</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 500;">
          Basic HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. Built with Astro and lazily hosted on Netlify's free tier. I make exactly zero dollars here, matching my incentive to exploit your data perfectly at zero.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4" style="font-weight: 850;">the ai question</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 500;">
          Yes, I use AI like everyone else who's discovered ctrl+c exists. It's my digital unpaid intern that catches typos my shaky hands create and makes images because apparently drawing stick figures doesn't count as "professional branding." It's mostly a spell-checker that has a philosophy degree and won't shut up about it.<br /><br />
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-weight: 500;">
          <strong style="font-weight: 850;">80% of AI's output gets yeeted into the digital void</strong> for sounding like a LinkedIn influencer had a baby with a fortune cookie. But the rest? The rest is 100% organic, free-range human stupidity. No algorithm has successfully replicated this particular flavor of chaos. And trust me, I've tried.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4" style="font-weight: 850;">why tell you this?</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 500;">
          I'm not some pretentious artisanal blogger typing manifestos on a hand-cranked typewriter powered by sustainably harvested pinecones, perched in a treehouse made of reclaimed driftwood, wearing denim distressed by authentic woodland creatures, and sipping tea from herbs I foraged blindfolded during a new moon. <br /><br /> I'm just a flawed, overly caffeinated human using modern tools to throw my thoughts onto your screen.<br /><br />
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-weight: 500;">
          Sure, bots did their part, but the final chaotic blend of sarcasm, humor, and questionable choices? That's entirely my fault. Please direct all complaints directly at me.
