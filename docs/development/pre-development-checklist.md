# Pre-Development Checklist

## üîç Research Phase

### Check for Existing Functionality
- [ ] Search codebase: `grep -r "feature_name" src/`
- [ ] Review `docs/INDEX.md` for similar features
- [ ] Check `src/components/` for related components
- [ ] Look in `src/lib/` for existing utilities
- [ ] Review `src/content/config.ts` for schema overlap

### Understand Architecture
- [ ] Read `docs/architecture/overview.md`
- [ ] Review component patterns in `docs/architecture/components.md`
- [ ] Check memory management patterns
- [ ] Understand data flow requirements

## üìã Planning Phase

### Define Requirements
- [ ] What problem does this solve?
- [ ] Who will use this feature?
- [ ] What are the success criteria?
- [ ] Are there performance constraints?

### Technical Planning
- [ ] Does it need new frontmatter fields?
- [ ] Will it affect existing components?
- [ ] Does it require TypeScript modules?
- [ ] Will it impact build process?
- [ ] Does it need new CSS/styles?

### Integration Points
- [ ] Where will users interact with it?
- [ ] How does it fit with existing UI?
- [ ] Does it need documentation updates?
- [ ] Will it affect SEO or accessibility?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Ready

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Development server running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Tests can run (`npm test` setup verified)
- [ ] TypeScript checking works (`npx tsc --noEmit`)

### Code Quality Requirements
- [ ] Plan to follow existing patterns
- [ ] Use TypeScript modules in `src/lib/`
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup (EventManager)
- [ ] Include accessibility features
- [ ] Plan test coverage

### Documentation Plan
- [ ] Identify which docs category it belongs in
- [ ] Plan word count (100-300 words)
- [ ] Prepare code examples
- [ ] Consider user workflow impact

## üöÄ Ready to Start

### Final Checks
