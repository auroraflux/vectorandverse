# Project Quick Status

**Updated**: 2025-07-12
**Version**: 1.3.0
**Status**: Active Development

## What This Is
Kilowhat - A minimal, typography-focused blog built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, featuring smooth animations and a clean reading experience.

## Current State
- [x] Core blog functionality complete
- [x] Touch gestures and mobile interactions implemented
- [x] "Main" accessibility issue resolved (browser extension)
- [x] Logo dimming issue fixed
- [x] Refactoring plan created and validated
- [x] Code quality plan completed
- [x] JavaScript refactoring guide created
- [ ] JavaScript modularization (1000+ lines to extract)
- [ ] TypeScript migration for testability
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities (XSS from innerHTML)
- [ ] Memory leak fixes

## Key Files
- `/code-quality-plan.md` - Comprehensive maintainability analysis
- `/javascript-refactoring-guide.md` - Practical implementation steps
- `/refactoring-plan.md` - Validated technical debt items
- `/src/pages/index.astro` - 300+ lines of inline JavaScript
- `/src/components/TouchLightbox.astro` - 250+ lines touch handling
- `/src/styles/sticky-header.css` - Fixed dimming issue

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 1**: Extract Typewriter animation to TypeScript module
2. **Phase 2**: Fix XSS vulnerabilities (replace innerHTML)
3. **Phase 3**: Extract TouchLightbox to testable class
4. **Phase 4**: Add Vitest and write tests
5. **Phase 5**: Memory leak prevention with lifecycle utilities

## Known Issues
- **Critical**: 1000+ lines of untestable inline JavaScript
- **High**: Memory leaks from uncleared event listeners
- **High**: XSS vulnerability from direct innerHTML usage
- **Medium**: Global state pollution (window object abuse)
- **Medium**: Magic numbers throughout (no constants)

## Quick Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run preview    # Preview production build
npm test           # Run tests (once added)
```

## Recent Changes
- Added comprehensive code quality analysis documenting JavaScript debt
- Created practical refactoring guide with TypeScript examples
- Identified security vulnerabilities and memory leaks
- Proposed phased migration maintaining backward compatibility
